A Twitter bot to scream redundancies at the good people of twitterverse.


a summation
===========

in short, my goal is to create a twitter bot with the 'twitter' gem that searches all of twitter for tweets mentioning someone and containing "what?" as the sole text (aside from @username of course). the bot would then take the original tweet that got mentioned by "what?", convert the text to ALL CAPS, and scream it at the "what?"er.


use case example
===========

@POTUS tweeted...

Bongo drums in the head.


@JoeBiden tweeted...

@POTUS what?


@hearingaid_ tweeted...

@JoeBiden @POTUS BONGO DRUMS IN THE HEAD.


an ending
